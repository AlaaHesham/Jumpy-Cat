2D Game using C++ and OpenGL 
Like Flappy Bird, a cat has 3 lives and should jump between columns of pipes. If it hits any of the pipes, it loses a life. If it hits the ceilling or the floor, then the game is over. Also if the player loses all 3 lives then they lose and the game is over. There are 4 levels that change randomely, one of them has a power-up, if taken, the cat can go through the pipes without losing any lives.
